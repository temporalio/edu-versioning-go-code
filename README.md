# Code Repository for Temporal Versioning (Go)
This repository provides code used for exercises and demonstrations
included in the Go version of the 
[Versioning](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/versioning) 
training course.

It's important to remember that the example code used in this course was designed to support learning a specific aspect of Temporal, not to serve as a ready-to-use template for implementing a production system.
